# 0x15. C - File I/O

## Description

I'm excited to dive into the world of file input/output operations in C for this project. Through this project, I'll be exploring various aspects of file handling, including file descriptors, system calls such as open, close, read, and write, managing file permissions, and working with text files.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I expect to achieve the following learning objectives:

- **Finding Information:** I'll be adept at finding the right information online to tackle various file I/O challenges.

- **File Operations:** I'll have the skills to create, open, close, read, and write files effectively.

- **Understanding File Descriptors:** I'll grasp the concept of file descriptors and their significance in file operations.

- **Standard File Descriptors:** I'll become familiar with the three standard file descriptors (stdin, stdout, stderr) and their respective purposes.

- **System Calls:** I'll be proficient in using essential I/O system calls, including open, close, read, and write, to manipulate files.

- **Flags and Permissions:** I'll understand how to work with flags like O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR, as well as set file permissions when creating a file using the open system call.

- **Differentiating Functions and System Calls:** I'll be able to distinguish between functions and system calls in C programming.

## Requirements

Here are the project requirements and guidelines that I'll adhere to:

- **Editors:** I'll use editors like vi, vim, or emacs for writing code.

- **Compilation:** I'll compile my code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following options: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

- **Code Style:** My code will follow the Betty style, and I'll use betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl for checking.

- **New Lines:** All my files will end with a new line.

- **README.md:** I've included a README.md file at the root of the project folder.

- **Global Variables:** I'll avoid using global variables.

- **C Standard Library Functions:** I'll restrict the use of C standard library functions to malloc, free, and exit.

- **Allowed Syscalls:** I'm allowed to use syscalls like read, write, open, close.

- **Header File:** I've created a header file named main.h, containing prototypes for all functions and the _putchar function.

- **Include Guard:** I've included include guards in all my header files.

## Tasks

Let's delve into the tasks of this project:

### 0. Tread lightly, she is near (mandatory)

I'll start by writing a function that reads a text file and prints its content to the POSIX standard output.

### 1. Under the snow (mandatory)

In this task, I'll create a function that can create a file.

### 2. Speak gently, she can hear (mandatory)

Next, I'll implement a function that appends text at the end of an existing file.

### 3. cp (mandatory)

I'll develop a program for copying the content of one file to another.

### 4. elf (advanced)

For the advanced task, I'll create a program to display information from the ELF header of an ELF file.

## Quiz Questions

- Great! I've successfully completed the quiz, and I'm ready to tackle the tasks ahead!

## Resources

### Read or Watch
